A [Contacts Manager](https://contacts-manager-e486f.firebaseapp.com) application built on Angular 1.5 components, ui-router 1.0.0, Firebase. Want to build it? Jump on my [Angular 1.5 Master course](https://courses.toddmotto.com).

### List of features:

- Angular 1.5 `.component()` method
- Stateful/stateless and routed components
- One-way dataflow
- Lifecycle hooks
- ui-router 1.0.0
- Firebase auth and database/hosting
- Fully tested, including spec files

### Setup and install

To run this app, follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/toddmotto/ultimate-angular-master-seed). Basically `npm install` and `npm start`. Run tests with `npm test`. Have fun!

Yes, I'm going to convert this to ES6, and maybe TypeScript. You're welcome to PR the transition (open an issue first) but please don't change application functionality or anything else :)
